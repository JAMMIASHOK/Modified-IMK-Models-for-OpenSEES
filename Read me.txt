*** UPDATE August 2020 ***
--> Use the provided OpenSEES executable directly. This compiled executable contains the most updated IMK models.


** These DLL files only work on Windows machines **
Steps:
1) Add the DLL file in the same directory as the OpenSEES.exe file.
2) Add the new materials to your code as you typically do for any other material. See attached PDF files for command sytax. No subroutine-sourcing is required in your main code.
3) Make sure you are using OpenSEES executable v2.5.0 (revision 6536) or later.

** DLL file for IMK Bilin is only available for now. The DLL files for the IMK PeakOriented and Pinching models will be uploaded soon.
